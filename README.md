# Animated-Icons-with-CSS3
Example showing how to animate an item on hover. 
The example shows both rotation of the X and Y axis.

Just add the css file roatetXY.css to your project, but make sure you use the following HTML to make sure your CSS works.

```html
<ul class="list-unstyled">
    <li><a href="#" class="icon"></a></li>
    <li><a href="#" class="icon2"></a></li>
</ul>
```

The icons are generated via font awesome and are added via CSS.
Just change the content: "\f09b"; to change or add new a new icon.
